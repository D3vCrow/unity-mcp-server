# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Miss-triggered search facets** — `unity_search_by_component` and `unity_search_assets` both take a free-text enum the agent has to guess (a component type name, an asset type name). A wrong guess returned `"Component type 'X' not found"` or an empty list, and the only recovery was to guess again — one wasted round-trip per wrong guess, often several in a row. Now, **when and only when a search misses**, the response carries the real values with counts: `availableComponentTypes` (from the existing `search/scene-stats` route) or `availableAssetTypes` (from a retry with the type filter dropped), plus a `hint` telling the agent to pick from the list. New `src/search-facets.js`, 25 tests in `src/search-facets.test.js`. Node-seam only — **zero C# plugin edits, no Unity recompile needed**.
  - A hit is never enriched and never pays for a second bridge call.
  - A facet-lookup failure returns the original result untouched — enrichment can never downgrade a working search into an error.
  - Error envelopes keep their `error` key, so `isErrorResult()` still sets the MCP `isError` flag (WIN A stays intact).
  - Pattern lifted from the speedrun talent network API, which ships live facet counts on every list response so callers "discover valid values instead of guessing". Deviation on purpose: there the facets are free (same query), here they cost a round-trip, so they fire only on the miss. See `knowledge/research/2026-07-28-vet-speedrun-talent-network-developers.md` in the Dev workspace.

## [2.28.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **MCP JSON-RPC framing corrupted by debug logs on stdout** — Two `console.debug(...)` call sites in `src/unity-editor-bridge.js` and `src/tool-tiers.js` wrote diagnostic lines to stdout, which the MCP stdio transport reserves exclusively for JSON-RPC messages. Strict clients (Codex CLI) closed the transport on the first non-JSON chunk; lenient clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) tolerated it, which is why the bug escaped earlier detection. Both call sites now use `console.error(...)` so logs go to stderr. Fixes [#11](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/issues/11).

## [2.28.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **npm publish workflow** — Added `--allow-same-version` to `npm version` command to prevent CI failure when `package.json` already matches the release tag

## [2.28.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **SpriteAtlas tools** — 7 new tools for Unity SpriteAtlas management (contributed by [@zaferdace](https://github.com/zaferdace)):
  - `spriteatlas/create` — Create a new SpriteAtlas asset
  - `spriteatlas/info` — Get SpriteAtlas details (packed sprites, settings)
  - `spriteatlas/add` — Add sprites/folders to a SpriteAtlas
  - `spriteatlas/remove` — Remove entries from a SpriteAtlas
  - `spriteatlas/settings` — Configure packing, texture, and platform settings
  - `spriteatlas/delete` — Delete a SpriteAtlas asset
  - `spriteatlas/list` — List all SpriteAtlases in the project
- New `spriteatlas-bridge.js` and `spriteatlas-tools.js` modules

### Added
- **npm auto-publish** — GitHub Action that automatically publishes to npm whenever a new GitHub release is created (contributed by [@vatanaksoytezer](https://github.com/vatanaksoytezer) in [#8](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/pull/8))

### Changed
- **npm package renamed** — Package renamed from `unity-mcp-server` to `anklebreaker-unity-mcp` to avoid name conflict on npm. Install via `npx anklebreaker-unity-mcp@latest`

### Fixed
- **UTF-8 encoding** — Fixed mojibake characters (corrupted em-dashes, arrows, section headers) across all comments in `unity-editor-bridge.js`; removed stale BOM
- **package-lock.json** — Synced version field to 2.27.0
